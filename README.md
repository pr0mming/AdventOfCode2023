## Advent of Code 2023

This is my first attempt solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), It's just an implementation using Go!

## Getting Started :rocket:

- You can use the **Makefile** to run a solution for an specific problem, for example the **problem 1** and the **part 1**:

```bash
make run_11
```

- Otherwise Go from the root folder of the project:

```bash
go run main.go 1 1
```

## Technologies :fire:

I used these technologies:

- [Go 1.21](https://go.dev/) - Go rules!.

## TODO List :page_with_curl:

- Add **time execution** for each problem solution.
- See **improvements** in the implementations
- Solve **all** the problems!
